 * Custom hook to get all available context files from the vault.
 * Includes all supported file types (markdown, canvas, PDFs, docx, code files, etc.) for all users.
 * Automatically updates when files are created, deleted, or renamed.
 * Files are sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first).
 *
 * Data is managed by the singleton VaultDataManager, which provides:
 * - Single set of vault event listeners (eliminates duplicates)
 * - Debounced updates (250ms) to batch rapid file operations
 * - Stable array references to prevent unnecessary re-renders
 *
 * @returns Array of TFile objects sorted by creation date (newest first)
